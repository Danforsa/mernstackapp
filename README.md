I’ve created the front end Task Management web app and got it to interact with  ,back end Node.js server and MongoDB database. To accomplish this I did following:
Create a React application that:
Uses following components:
	▪	A header
	▪	A Task component
	▪	A Task List component

	
Allows  Sign in (with google gmail login with google's api) 
 and the user to:
		
	▪       Add tasks
	▪	Delete tasks
	▪	Edit existing tasks
	▪	Mark tasks as complete
	▪	Filter tasks by: 
		● Completed tasks 
		● Tasks that must still be completed
		● Deadline 	
		● Tasks that are overdue
