I’ve created the front end Task Management web app and got it to interact with  ,back end Node.js server and MongoDB database. To accomplish this I did following:
Create a React application that:
○ Uses following components:
	▪	A header
	▪	A Task component
	▪	A Task List component
      THis allows  the user to  Sign in with google login (with google's api) 
		the user to:
	▪	Add tasks
	▪	Delete tasks
	▪	Edit existing tasks
	▪	Mark tasks as complete
