# mernstackapp

I’ve created the front end Task Management web app and got it to interact with  back end Node.js server and MongoDB database. To accomplish this I did following:
●  Create a React application that: 
○ Uses following components:
	▪	A header 
	▪	A Task component 
	▪	A Task List component 
○ Allows   Sign in with google api 
the user to:
	▪	Add tasks 
	▪	Delete tasks 
	▪	Edit existing tasks 
	▪	Mark tasks as complete
